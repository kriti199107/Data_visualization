# TITANIC DISASTER

## Summary

An online dataset on the very famous titanic disaster is available on Kaggle. As mentioned in the description on the website, even though the main reason for the loss of lives was a lack of sufficient number of lifeboats, there seem to be other factors involved as well. We will try to determine the factors that may have influenced the survival chances of passengers through data visualization alone!

Some of the questions that I intend to explore in this dataset are as follows:
(1)	Is passenger class a factor?
(2)	Is sex of the passenger a factor?
(3)	Is age group a factor?

## Observation and Conclusion:

From the plots it is clear that the per cent of survivors are higher for richer people (travelling in first class), women and children. This is probably because rich, women and children were given a priority for the lifeboats!
 

## Design

Iteration1:

I chose bar plots for data visualization. This is because, we are mostly interested in the number of people that survived. It is easiest to visualize relative comparison of counts in a bar plot.

Iteration 2:
Based on the feedback, bar plot seems like a good choice as people did not have difficulty in understanding the charts, However, it was pointed out that there is scope for improvement aesthetically. Therefore, some changes were made to the charts by improving the legends and using more colors. 

Iteration 3:
I added some transition buttons which allows you to select a factor to study the graphs. I removed the comments in thos file as the graphs are self explanotory. This is the final version: version3

Iteration 4:
Based on the feedback from the reviewer, I have shown all the graphs in per cent of survivors. This provides better clarity!

## Feedback

Iteration1 is saved in the code file by the name version1. I chose to take feedback from three people in person. This helped in understanding their point better as well as acting on my revision faster. Following is a record of some useful feedback I received that I incorporated in version 2 of my project.

Feedback 1: My version 1 did not have animations. So, it was difficult to absorb a lot of data and charts at once. It was suggested that I use some animation that would focus on one factor or chart at one point.

Feedback 2: The survivors and victims on the legend are represented by "1" and "0" respectively. This is not very clear to a person who is not so familiar with the datset.

Feedback 3: The charts that compare the survivors and victims across different categorical classes would be clearer if they are represented by different colors.
